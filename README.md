# Zelkova

Like Elm, but different species.

Zelkova is my attempt to understand how one could build a functional programming language compiling to web assembly. It is −very, very− strongly inspired by Elm, with some Haskell addition.

Do not expect any production-level code here, I'm just trying to understand how a compiler works :)
