//! This module contains the type checker pass of the language
//!
//! It works with the source AST and will perform two jobs:
//! - type checks the different declarations and expression
//! - infer the types when not declared in the source
//!
//! I have no idea how that works; so bear with me while I explore
//! the space, make mistake and (hopefully) learn something :)
//!
//! Some papers on type inference:

//! A type inference problem consists of a type environment Γ , an expression t, and a type T of kind ?
//!
//! Constraint generation rules:
//!
//! - Equation 1: ⟦x : T⟧ = x ≼ T
//!   "x has type T if and only if T is an instance of the type scheme associated with x"
//!   Important part: There is no relation to the typing environment Γ, instead x appears free (and will be bound to Γ later)
//!
//! - Equation 2: ⟦λz.t : T⟧ = ∃X1X2.(let z : X1 in ⟦t : X2⟧ ∧ X1 → X2 ≤ T)
//!   "λz.t has type T if and only if, for some X1 and X2,
//!     (i) under the assumption that z has type X1, t has type X2, and
//!     (ii) T is a supertype of X1 → X2."
//!   z and t types must be fresh (can't generally guess them). They are _existentially_ bound because we are going to
//!   solve their values. Note that z is _not_ fresh in the condition (i).
//!
//! - Equation 3: ⟦t1 t2 : T⟧ = ∃X2.(⟦t1 : X2 → T⟧ ∧ ⟦t2 : X2⟧)
//!   "t1 t2 has type T if and only if, for some X2, t1 has type X2 → T and t2 has type X2"
//!
//! - Equation 4: ⟦let z = t1 in t2 : T⟧ = let z : ∀X[⟦t1 : X⟧].X in ⟦t2 : T⟧
//!   "let z = t1 in t2 has type T if and only if, under the assumption that z has every type X such that ⟦t1 : X⟧ holds, t2 has type T"
//!
