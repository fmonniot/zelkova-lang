//! This module contains the type checker pass of the language
//! 
//! It works with the result of the frontend and will perform two jobs:
//! - type checks the different declarations and expression
//! - infer the types when not declared in the source
//! 
//! I have no idea how that works; so bear with me while IÂ explore
//! the space, make mistake and (hopefully) learn something :)
//! 
//! Some papers on type inference:
